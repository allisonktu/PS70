### Week 10: Machine Building and End Effectors

This week's project was to build a machine. I decided to work on a component of one of the parts of my final project. The final project part will be a machine that automatically punches holes in cardstock to create the cardstock piece that runs through the music box. This week, I decided to work just on the bit that will roll the paper forward.

I managed to design a box and 3D model of the wheels that will fit onto the stepper motor and roll the paper forward before getting really sick from the COVID booster. As of Thursday, I'm feeling well enough to come to class but I'm still having nausea, headache, and focus problems, so I'm going to try to finish the project over the weekend (let's hope I feel better by then...).
