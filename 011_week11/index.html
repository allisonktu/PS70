### Week 11: Computer Programming

This week's project was to build an MVP of the hardest part of our final project. The hardest part of the project, by far, is my automatic hole puncher, so I decided to continue my machine building work from last week. The machine has three separate parts, which I will definitely not be able to finish by the end of this week, but I'm going to get as much done as possible.

First of all, because this is an intimidating project, I began by giving my machine a name. I have christened him Punchy McPunchface, which makes me smile every time I see the folder on my laptop. Once that was settled, I moved onto making some plans. I sat down with PK, who helped me brainstorm lots of helpful ideas. I broke down this machine into three parts:

<ul>
  <li>The roller, which will move the paper forward</li>
  <li>The puncher, which will actually punch the hole in the paper</li>
  <li>The slider, which will move the puncher side to side</li>
</ul> 

Then, I drew up this diagram. Unfortunately, my drawing skills are not up to snuff, but I labeled everything to make it as clear as possible. I'm envisioning a box, which will hopefully eventually be made of sheet metal, but will be cardboard as I prototype. The back half of the box will be a cylinder holding extra paper (think like a roll of butcher paper) plus the punching mechanism and slider. The front half of the box will be the roller mechanism to move the paper forward.

On the lower half of the drawing, you can see more details of the puncher. I'd like to cut two metal brackets out of sheet metal, and screw them together, then thread the paper through. This will hopefully provide enough tension so the paper can be punched. Then, I'll use a rack and pinion mechanism and a stepper motor to make the vertical punching motion. I purchased the music box, which comes with the hole punch that has a punch the correct size for the needed holes, so I'll take it apart onces it comes and stick the punch onto the rack. Hopefully, if the stepper motor moves fast enough, it'll punch successfully and cleanly.

I had to finish up the roller part from last week because I was sick last week and couldn't make it into the lab much. This began with making a roller that would fit directly onto the motor shaft, but it didn't quite fit, so I printed 3 more test pieces to see which would fit over the shaft best: ones with diameters of 4.9 mm, 5.0 mm, and 5.1 mm. Sadly, none of those fit, so I tried some more testers: 5.2, 5.3, and 5.5 mm. The 5.3 fit perfectly over the motor shaft, so I proceeded with that. I printed 

Once I got that settled, the rest of this week was failure after disaster after failure. 


Once the roller was in a functioning place, I moved onto the hole punching part. I found [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3725863) rack and pinion mechanism on Thingiverse and downloaded it so I could make edits that would suit my project.
