### Week 12: Wildcard

Since we were mostly working on final projects this week, many of my updates are on that page. However, I did get to do some fun workshops, and I've documented all those here!

First, Nathan taught us about composites. I followed Nathan's simple composite [workflow](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Projects/composites_S19/index.html) after the workshop because I was curious about dying the resin. I took the leftover resin from the workshop and dyed it blue with the Smooth On Slic Pig pigment we have in the shop (it seems to be typically used for dying silicone). I just stirred the pigment and added a small amount--basically what was leftover on the popsicle stick after stirring--to the resin. It seemed to work pretty well and mixed in just fine. I then picked a foam plate mold from the bin of composite examples and cut two pieces of canvas and a piece of batting to use as breather material. I also cut a piece of plastic wrap, wrapped it over the foam plate mold, and sprayed it with mold release, and made a bag using the vacuum sealer that would fit everything. Then, I used our yellow spreaders to spread my dyed resin evenly on both pieces of canvas. Finally, I stacked the canvas-resin sheets on top of each other on the mold, added a piece of plastic wrap with holes in it from the torture device, popped the cotton batting on top, and shoved the whole assembly into the vacuum bag I made. I used the vacuum sealer to pull a vacuum on it and let it sit for a day before cutting it open.
