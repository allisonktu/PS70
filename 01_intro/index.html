### Week 1: Introduction 

This week, I started to famarilize myself with HTML and CSS, working on this website to share my documentation throughout the semester. I have very minimal coding experience (one high school programming class with a rather subpar teacher) and I have not used HTML or CSS before, so this was a challenge for me. As I worked on the website, however, I became more comfortable with editing the template we were given. I have also filled my browsing history with Stack Overflow and w3 Schools, which have been fantastic resources for every little syntax mistake. I chose a color palette for the website and I plan to make plenty of additional changes to the site aesthetic as the semester goes on.

Additionally, I've also been working on ideas for my final project, and have settled on the following three. While I agree with Nathan's suggestion that we present several ideas and pick one we're leaning toward, I love all of these ideas and it's hard for me to choose just one that I would most like to create.

####Smart Alarm Clock
Every morning, an obnoxious Apple ringtone blares from my phone to wake me up. For a college student often waking up earlier than I'd like to, this is jarring and unpleasant. I've seen smart alarm clocks out there that slowly increase the volume of pleasant music and brightness of a warm light to promote a more gentle wake-up, and I love the idea. However, the commercial options are expensive and not particularly attractive.

I would design an alarm clock with similar functionality, but make it more compact and add more elegant design elements. This might include a laser cut wood cutout that comprises the frame of the clock or 3d-printed flowers. I would also add a silm drawer where I could leave my morning medication. When the clock goes off, this drawer could pop out, reminding me to take the pills.

####Video Game Phone Arcade
One of my favorite YouTube channels is Evan & Katelyn, two makers with a similar maker philosophy as this course. A while ago, they made [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoYdZb490nc) 3D printed wireless phone charger, which they designed to look like a mini arcade. I loved their design, which included LEDs within the casing that contributed to their galaxy doughnut theme.

However, my phone is not capable of wireless charging, and I think it would be way more fun to make an actual mini arcade instead of just a charger. Evan & Katelyn provided their 3D model, but I would design a different one from scratch that fits my phone and a different theme (perhaps disco?). I could then make a simple video game that I could pull up on my phone and slide into the phone holder. Unlike Evan & Katelyn's design, I would also try to make the buttons actually functional, such that the experience would be similar to an actual arcade game.

####Music Box with Responsive Lights
I love the whimsy of mechanical music boxes, but I hate that you have to buy tons of different ones if you want to play different tunes. For this project, I'd design a music box that works with cardstock strips, such that you can easily change the tune anytime by making and inserting a different piece of cardstock. This functionality would be similar to [this](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/mechanical-music-box-set) commercial music box. In addition to the mechanical music playing, I would add lights that would respond to the music, with different colors or patterns depending on the intensity and pitch of the sound.
