### Week 3: 3D Printing

This week, we tackled 3D printing. I decided to use this week to improve upon my kinetic sculpture from last week. I thought of a few things that could improve the sculpture, including making bevel gears. However, I decided that, for the type of movement I wanted, I wouldn't actually need bevel gears. Instead, I landed on improving the aesthetics of the sculpture by 3D printing flowers, which I hoped would look better than the cardboard + vinyl flower I used last week. I love tulips, so that's what I'll try to print.

As someone new to Fusion, I had no idea where to start with a complex organic shape like a tulip. I looked up a few tutorials and found [this](https://www.instructables.com/Fusion-360-3D-Printable-Flower/) one, which was a great, in-depth tutorial. I followed it step-by step up through step 6, though I skipped the heart cutouts because I don't love the look of them. I ditched the rest of the tutorial to go my own way, which involved copying the base petal shape, changing its scale until I liked it, and making circular patterns to have repeating petals. Once all the petal layers were in place, I cut a sphere and stuck the partial hemisphere at the bottom of the flower to round out the bottom and help join all the petals to each other. Finally, I cut a little cylinder out of the bottom so I can glue the skewer in there later. It took a long time to get the flower looking exactly how I wanted, but two hours later, I was done. It's not perfect, but I like that it's not geometrically consistent because that makes it look more like a real flower. 

##INSERT 3D MODEL HERE

I could've just looked up a flower model, but I'm glad I followed the tutorial because it helped me learn a lot more about Fusion: both different tools that the software has (chamfer and fillet were especially useful) and different ways to think about how to model something (for instance, the method of making a petal by starting with a sphere then cutting it a bunch of times using different tool shapes was awesome).
