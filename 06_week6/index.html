### Week 6: Electronic input devices

This week's project was to build a sensor. As an avid knitter, as soon as I saw Velostat as an option, I knew I wanted to use it for some kind of flexible sensor. I decided to create a pressure sensor enclosed in a knit fabric envelope, with the end goal of measuring how many pounds of force were on the sensor. This could be applied in something like a massage setting, where the sensor could be incorporated into a garment to help the person giving the massage calibrate how much force they're using.

I began by cutting a piece of Velostat and knitting a piece of fabric to enclose it. Quick knitting pattern for knitters: Using DK or sport weight yarn, CO 20 sts on size 6 ndls, st st for 6 inches, BO, break yarn, weave in ends. Fold the fabric in half with the wrong sides facing out, creating a pocket. Crochet the sides together. Turn the pocket inside out so the right sides are facing out.
