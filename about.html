### About Me

I'm Allison, a senior in Pfoho studying Psychology with a secondary in Global Health and Health Policy. I plan to pursue medicine and I'm particularly interested in pediatrics or primary care as a way to address inequities in healthcare access. On campus, I started Harvard's knitting circle, volunteer teaching kids how to cook, and dance with the ballroom team. I also enjoy running long distances very slowly, playing guitar,  and baking. Since high school, I've enjoyed tinkering with laser cutters and throwing together things like custom guitar picks and prop weapons for a ballroom performance with my very limited skills, but I'm so excited to apply what I learn in this course to new and better projects.
