### Final Project: Music Box

####Inspiration
I love music boxes, and onces saw [this](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/mechanical-music-box-set) commercial music box, which lets you punch notes into cardstock strips to make different tunes.

####Story
The commercially available product is cute, but very limiting. You only get a certain number of cardstock strips that have to be up to certain specifications, so if you want more music, you have to buy more. It's also a little boring! Music boxes are an adorable concept and should be cute.

####Opportunity
I love the whimsy of mechanical music boxes, but the current options aren't great. You can either purchase the inspiration one, which significantly limits your options, or you can just own dozens of music boxes for different tunes. For this project, I'd either design a music box that works with cardstock strips, such that you can easily change the tune anytime by making and inserting a different piece of cardstock, or I'd design one that you can program to play a certain song. I'd also love for the turning of the music box crank to move a dancer, or have some similar kinetic sculpture element. If I go a purely mechanical route for the music box itself (as opposed to programming the box to play different songs), I would add lights that would respond to the music, with different colors or patterns depending on the intensity and pitch of the sound.

####References
<ul>
  <li>[This](https://www.musichouseshop.com/store/TunesCylinderMechanismsAndDisks.html) website has a ton of music box parts for sale and describes how the typical mechanism works.</li>
  <li>[Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/music_box_parts) has a ton of beautiful, custom music boxes that are wonderful artistic inspiration.</li>
</ul>

####Project Plan
After doing some preliminary research, I'm thinking that one of the limiting factors here will be how small music boxes usually are. I'm anticipating a lot of challenges making a functioning mechanism for a mechanical music box that's as small as I want it. Therefore, I'm considering pivoting to making a larger box that's based around hitting wind chimes instead of playing a piano-like board, which is how typical music boxes work. The wind chime box could be programmable to play different tunes: the basic idea is that you'd input certain notes and then the box would play them by hitting the wind chimes with xylophone hammers or something similar. However, I still prefer the charm of a small mechanical music box, so I'll think more about how I can get that to work. 

####Materials List
This list is in progress, since I'm still figuring out exactly how I can get this to work.
<ul>
  <li>Wind chimes or music box keys</li>
  <li>Plywood</li>
  <li>Clear acrylic</li>
  <li>Basic joining materials (screws, nuts, bolts)</li>
  <li>Twine or fishing line</li>
  <li>Clear acrylic</li>
  <li>Xylophone hammers or something similar</li>
  <li>Clear acrylic</li>
  <li>Paint and paintbrushes</li>
  <li>LEDs</li>
  <li>Other basic circuit materials (Arduino, resistors, breadboard, solder and soldering iron)</li>
</ul>

####Timeline
The current timeline is limited because I still haven't figured out which option (wind chimes vs traditional music box) will be doable for this project. These would be very different builds, so I'll wait to flesh this out more until I have a better idea.
<ul>
  <li>Week 5: Discuss plans with Ibrahim and determine whether I'll move forward with the wind chime or regular music box idea. Program an Arduino to turn on LEDs in response to sound OR push a hammer out on command (the latter would help me with the wind chime idea</li>
  <li>Week 6: Flesh out materials list more fully and develop project sketches. Update timeline based on sketches.</li>
</ul>
