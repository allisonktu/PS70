### Final Project: Music Box

####Inspiration
I love music boxes, and onces saw [this](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/mechanical-music-box-set) commercial music box, which lets you punch notes into cardstock strips to make different tunes.

####Story
The commercially available product is cute, but very limiting. You only get a certain number of cardstock strips that have to be up to certain specifications, so if you want more music, you have to buy more. It's also a little boring! Music boxes are an adorable concept and should be cute.

####Opportunity
I love the whimsy of mechanical music boxes, but the current options aren't great. You can either purchase the inspiration one, which significantly limits your options, or you can just own dozens of music boxes for different tunes. For this project, I'd design a music box that works with cardstock strips, such that you can easily change the tune anytime by making and inserting a different piece of cardstock. I'd also love for the turning of the music box crank to move a dancer, or have some similar kinetic sculpture element. In addition to the mechanical music playing, I would add lights that would respond to the music, with different colors or patterns depending on the intensity and pitch of the sound.
